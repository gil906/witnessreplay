SERVER RESTART REQUIRED
======================

The Feature Agent has made code changes that require the backend server to be restarted.

WHY RESTART IS NEEDED:
1. Admin portal routes were added to main.py (lines 115-125) but server is still running old code
2. 8 routes in routes.py are not registered in OpenAPI spec (only 12 of 20 show up)
3. The route ordering is correct in code, but server needs to reload the module

ROUTES MISSING FROM OPENAPI (will work after restart):
- /api/info (line 1094)
- /api/sessions/export/bulk (line 122)
- /api/sessions/{session_id}/export/evidence (line 216)
- /api/sessions/{session_id}/insights (line 438)
- /api/sessions/{session_id}/timeline (line 553)
- /api/models/status (line 1056)
- /admin (main.py line 115)
- /admin.html (main.py line 116)

HOW TO RESTART:
- The server is running as PID 1 in a Docker container
- If Docker is available: docker restart witnessreplay
- If running directly: kill -HUP 1 or systemctl restart witnessreplay
- The orchestrator should handle this automatically

CHANGES MADE IN THIS COMMIT:
1. Fixed Bug #42: Added ModelSelector.get_current_model() method
2. Fixed Bug #41: Improved PDF export error handling for empty sessions
3. Implemented Idea #3: Updated model priority to use gemini-2.5-pro for best scene quality
4. Verified Idea #2: Model rate limit checking already working
5. Verified Bug #3, #4, #6, #11: Already fixed in previous commits

After restart, all 20 routes will be accessible and admin portal will work.
